# BlockOut-Unity
 


## Notes

How to know if one layer is filled with blocks?
* Scan if 6x6=36 blocks have same y value.
* all blocks need to have landed before this check.

Blocks
* Build complex blocks out of single 'cube' blocks
* Connect single 'cube' blocks with fixed joint to combine them into complex blocks (this might not work properly)

Grid Wireframe Shader
* animated line position
* animated line color (gradient)

Animated Objects From Blender
* .mdd and .fbx allows to import animation
* example wave modifier
